v0.6 Release Notes
==================

* lots of bugfixes, refactoring and cleaning up of non-pythonic ugly code
* ported to pyproject 1.0
* using turnkey-pylib (paths, executil)

* config and archives are now stored in CHANKO_BASE (not in .container)
* packages are now only stored once (in archives), so --tree and --dir
  options have been removed from chanko-get
* hash has been renamed cache_id (thats what it is) and now guaranteed 
  to be unique

* auto-refresh:
  * local cache after getting packages
  * remote cache if no remote cache exists when asked to query remote
  * remote cache if sources.list has changed

* print query results from cli code
* using python sort() instead of piping query output through sort

* finding dummy sourceslist according to 'INSTALL_PATH'
